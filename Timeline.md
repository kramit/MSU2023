#### 9-12 August

AZ-900 is a one day Azure course, this course is designed to simply give an overview of some of the Azure services, it is normally a starting point for technical people and just enough info for non technical managers. There is an exam for the AZ-900 but we will not be doing it as the other exams we will complete will far outweigh the difficulty level of this beginner exam.

The custom content for 3 days is supposed to fill you in with some information about on-site Windows Servers and concepts, including some basic networking, Hyper-V / Virtual Machines, Active Directory, Group policy, and other on-site administration tasks your average administrator will use on a daily basis. I will add to this content as we go along and might throw in a bit of git and github for change control along with some VScode. You probably have some experience of this information already, think of this as a warm up week.

#### 15-19 August

AZ-040 is a basic-mid powershell course for 3 days, this is the normal timeline for this course and will cover powerhsell scripting that is essential for proper Azure administration in the future, if you have already done some Python, JS C# or any other programming the powershell will look pretty familiar to you and should be a pretty easy section. If you have not done any programming or scripting before, do not worry as this is designed to teach to sysadmins in the Windows world that have not written any code in the past. 

The 18-19th will be a first intro into AZ-104

#### 22-26 August

5 more days on AZ-104. AZ-104 is normally only a 4 day course but here we are extending it out to 7 days, this does not mean I will be adding in extra content as the primary task will be for you to pass the exam and complete a case study. Normally I would not expect anyone attending a 4 day course to take the exam on the final day, there is too much info. We do not have that luxury. So a lot of this extra time will be dedicated to your own self study and question research.

I will be with you every step of this, and we will spend a lot of time going over questions that Microsoft will throw at you and how to answer them.


#### 29 August - 2 September

29-30, This is the first 2 days dedicated for you to put together a case study. I have created 3 case studies for you in the case studies folder of this Github repo. (I may make more) you only need to do 2 of the case studies over the time we have. The purpose of them is so you can show you understand some of the material and how to create and document a solution. The final day on 16th Sept you will have to give a brief presentation to members of Microsoft and your class. Not too much to be worried about only "This is the client and the issues they face, this is what we propose for the client, and here is an example of the solution working" 


31st August is your exam day for the AZ-104, as an instructor I am not supposed to be teaching you on that day so Glasspaper may re-assign me to teach a 1 day course for other clients, we will find out closer to the day and I will let you know.

Last 2 days we start on the AZ-305, using the same tactics as we used to complete the AZ-104

#### 5-9 September

All AZ-305, there is a lot of crossover with the AZ-104 with probably around 30-40% new material to learn. The exam will be harder than the AZ-104 but you will now know what to expect and we will work through questions and techniques again.

#### 12-16th September

12th, AZ-305 exam day, again, I am not sure if I am going to be around during the day as Glasspaper may choose to have me teach a 1 day public course.

3 days of working on and polishing up those 2 case studies, ready for the Friday presentations. There maybe a post course party/meal out paid for by Microsoft, but don't hold me to that, we will find out the plan later on.
