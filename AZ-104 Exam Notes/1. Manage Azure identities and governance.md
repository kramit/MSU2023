### Manage subscriptions

An Azure subscription is a logical unit for setting up a resource boundary, environment boundary, and billing boundary. Each subscription has an account attached to it that can be a work or school account, or an account Azure AD trusts. 
- You can also use a Microsoft account to use Azure since Azure AD trusts these accounts.

An Azure account is *any* identity that's part of Azure AD, or a directory trusted by Azure AD.
- Note: if you sign up for an Azure account using a work or school account, any subscription will be created in the Azure AD your work or school account is part of.
  - When using a Microsoft account (or a personal account), Azure automatically generates an Azure AD tenant during the creation of your Azure account.
 
When you create an Azure account, you become the Account Administrator. By default, the account admin will have access to the new subscription. 
- In order to grant others access, you will need to use role based access control (RBAC).
- Note: Microsoft recommends using RBAC to grant access to users and any external users to Azure resources as classic roles are not being used anymore.

Multiple subscriptions can exist within the same Azure account. Some examples of reasons you'd want multiple subscriptions include, but are not limited to:
- Project isolation
- Environment isolation

There are several methods in which you can create an Azure subscription. Some of the following options may not be available for you as specific eligibility depends on terms & conditions of each offer:
- Enterprise Agreements (EAs)
- Web Direct
- Partners
- Resellers

### Cost management

Cloud governance includes managing your cloud cost. There are tools that can help you breakdown and track your costs. 

Azure Cost Management is a tool you can use to complete administrative billing tasks, including but not limited to: 
- Complete billing administrative tasks
- Create budgets and set alarts upon specific thresholds being passed
- Predict future costs using analytics
- Export data to Power BI dashboards using the Azure Cost Management connector
  - Note: this is only available to EA/MCA customers.
- Calculate potential savings and track reservation usage
- Schedule usage reports to be exported to a storage account for auditing
- Ingest AWS costs & analyze them within Azure

Azure Cost Management can be accessed from the Azure portal and will display charts that help explain your cloud spending. 

### Manage resource groups

A resource group is a container used for the logical organization of Azure resources. These make deploying, deleting, and/or updating resources in bulk an easy task, saving you time from having to manually apply any changes to the resources.
- Note: it's advised to use caution before deleting resource groups as you are unable to undo this action.

Resources can be part of the same solution or grouped together however you prefer. Resources groups can also include resources from different regions, but this means the metadata will be stored in the same region as the resource group is located in, as resource groups contain the metadata about any resources making up the group.  
- Note: grouping resources together for the same solution, or by the same type of resources, can help make managing them easier.

### Management groups

Management groups provide the ability to logically group Azure subscriptions together, offering a new scope above the subscriptions to be used to: 
- Grant access
- Assign policies
- Analyze costs

Cost management can be scoped at this level for tracking the costs of multiple subscriptions under one view. This includes creating budgets, which is particularily helpful for teams working on multiple projects under different subscriptions.

With your tenant, there will be a default management group that is referred to as the root management group. Creating new management groups can be performed from the Azure portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI, and these new groups will be created as *children* of the default management group.

There are two required parameters when you create a new management group:
- Management Group ID: used to specify the management group when running commands against it.
  - Note: this cannot be changed after creating the management group.
- Display name: used to point to the management group when using PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST API calls.

### Azure policy

This service allows you to create, assign, and manage policies. Rules can be enforced to ensure the org meets any compliance controls necessary. 

Azure policy will run evaluations constantly to resources are compliant and can make sure new resources are stopped before breaking any compliance requirements. 
- Note: Azure policy cannot delete resources that are reported as noncompliant, however, we can resolve any that are noncompliant.

Azure policy features include:
- Applying policies at scale
    - Policies can be applied to the management group level to be inherited by all subscriptions that are part of the group.
- Compliance and enforcement
    - Built-in or custom policies can be used to ensure compliance. Resources that don't meet compliance with your policies won't be deployed.
- Mitigation and remediation:
    - Remediation can be automated or performed manually.

Azure policy can help with the following scenarios:
- Prevent users from deploying expensive services (Cosmos DB, ExpressRoute, etc.)
- Require specific tags during resource deployment
- Require Azure Backup service is enabled on *all* VMs
- Limit VM deployment to only contain a specific set of SKUs, which helps prevent expensive VM SKUs from being deployed.
- Require resources to be deployed in specific regions, which helps the org meet any data residency requirements.


### Azure policy definition

To define policies: Azure portal > Policy > Definitions
- Note: add a filter to view built-in policies.
  - Using built-in policies will help reduce the time needed to write new policies.

The definition describes the action the policy will take when assigned. It's importation to note that this is in JSON format. 

The following information is required while defining the policy:
- Definition location
    - This is either the subscription or management group.
    - Note: policies that are defined at the subscription level cannot be assigned to management groups.
- Name
    - This will be the name that displays in the policy list. 
- Description
    - These will help others understand what the policy is for. 
- Category
    - These are helpful to filter policies.
- Policy rule
    - We have two options: Import from GitHub or write in the Azure portal using the editor.

Policies will contain a condition and effect.
- Condition: what is evaluated to confirm if the effect is applied or not.
- Effect: if the condition is matched, this is the action that is taken.


### Azure policy assignment & scope

Policy assignment is the process of assigning a definition to a specific scope. Once the assign page is selected, we can select the scope for the policy from the available scopes listed. 
- Note: it takes ~30mins for the evaluation report to be generated after assignment.
    - To assign custom policies to the management group, use the management group scope.
 
While assigning policies, the following information can be added on the Basics tab:
- Scope
    - This is where you would like the policy to apply.
- Exclusions
    - If any resources should be excluded, you would define those here.
    - Note: resources that are excluded will not be reported if they are noncompliant.
- Assignment name
    - This will be the name of the policy by default, however, it can be changed. 
- Description
    - This will help others understand the reason for the assignment.
- Policy enforcement
    - Disabled or enabled.
- Assigned by
    - By default, this will be the user that's currently assigning the policy.

Policy scope is the process that determines which subscriptions, resource groups, and resources are enforced by the policy. Management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups are included in supported scopes.


### Azure policy evaluation

A dashboard is provided to view the overall compliance of selected scopes, allowing you to remediate noncompliance. To view this dashboard: Policy > Overview > Compliance
