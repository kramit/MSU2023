# Monitor and maintain Azure resources (10â€“15%)

## Monitor resources by using Azure Monitor

- Configure and interpret metrics
- Configure Azure Monitor Logs
- Query and analyze logs
- Set up alerts and actions
- Configure monitoring of VMs, storage accounts, and networks by using VM insights

## Implement backup and recovery

- Create an Azure Recovery Services vault
- Create an Azure Backup vault
- Create and configure backup policy
- Perform backup and restore operations by using Azure Backup
- Configure Azure Site Recovery for Azure resources
- Perform failover to a secondary region by using Azure Site Recovery
- Configure and review backup reports


### Azure Backup

This service can be used to backup, protect, and restore data in Microsoft's cloud. It replaces any on-prem backup solution with a solution in the cloud, providing reliability, security, and provides cost benefits.
- Agents are available to download and deploy. The agent you choose will depend on what you want to protect.
- All agents, regardless of data residing on-prem or in the cloud, can be used to backup to a Recovery Services vault.

Benefits of using Azure Backup include:
- Keeping data secure using an encryption passphrase locally.
    - Note: this passphrase is *never* transmitted or stored in Azure
- Unlimited data transfer without added fees. Data isn't limited inbound or outbound (data transferred from a Recovery Services vault during a restore).
    - Note: initial backups offline using the import/export feature for large amounts of data will be associated with a cost for inbound data.
- App-consistent backups, meaning a recovery point has all data needed to restore the backup. This ensures there isn't a need for additional fixes to restore your data, saving you time getting back to a running state.
- Automatic storage management eliminates the need to implement on-prem storage for hybrid environments. Azure Backup will handle the allocation and manage the storage, and only requires orgs to pay for what they use.
- Offload on-prem backups to the cloud without any complex backup solutions being needed.
- Short term and long term data retention as there is no limit to the timeframe data can stay in the vault. However, Azure Backup does have a limit of 9,999 recovery points/protected instance.
- Various replication types for storage and high availability.
    - Geo-redundant storage (GRS): this is the default and recommended to use for replication. It replicates the data to another, secondary region far away.
        - Note: this method is more expensive than LRS, however, it also offers a higher level of durability in the event of a regional outage.
    - Locally redundant storage (LRS): data will be replicated 3 times in a storage scale unit within a datacenter. This method is less expensive than GRS and protects against hardware failures that occur within the same datacenter the data is stored in.
        - Note: ALL copies of the data will exist within the *same* region.
