# Deploy and manage Azure compute resources (20â€“25%)

## Automate deployment of resources by using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or Bicep files

- Interpret an ARM template or a Bicep file
- Modify an existing ARM template
- Modify an existing Bicep file
- Deploy resources by using an ARM template or a Bicep file
- Export a deployment as an ARM template or compile a deployment as a Bicep file

### Azure Resource Manager (ARM) 

ARM provides the ability to work with the resources in your solution as a group instead of individual components. 

- Deploy, update, or delete all resources for solutions in a single operation
- Use templates for deployment
-  Templates can work for testing, staging, and production environments
-  Provides security, auditing, and tagging to assist with managing resources after deployment
- Provides the ability to monitor all resources for your solution
- Repeatedly deploy solutions throughout the development lifecycle while ensuring they're deployed consistently
- Templates are declarative and can be used to manage the infrastructure instead of using scripts
- RBAC can be applied to all service within the resource group since it's natively integrated into the management platform
- Tags can help logically organize resources within the subscription
- The organization's billing can be clarified by viewing the costs for groups of resources using the same tags
	
	
ARM provides a way to consistently manage resources by performing tasks through:

- Azure PowerShell
- Azure CLI
- The Azure portal
- REST API
- Client SDKs

Take advantage of ARM while working with solutions by:

- Defining all deployment and config steps using the template(s). No manual steps should be required to setup solutions
- Running commands like starting/stopping an app or machine to manage resources
- Organizing resources with the same lifecycle using resource groups
	- Use tags to organize additional resources

### Azure Virtual Machines

Working with VMs allows you to have more control over the installed software and configuration settings. 

Characteristics of Azure VMs include:
- Based on the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) model, which is an instant computing infrastructre that's provisioned and managed over the web.
- VMs provide their own OS, storage, and networking capabilities, and can run a wide range of apps.
- VMs can be quickly scaled up and down on demand, allowing you to pay for what you use.
- Multiple VMs can be implemented, and each machine can be configured with different software and config settings to support different operations (deployment, testing, and deployment environments).
- Microsoft and the customer share responsibility associated with configuring and maintaining VMs.

Before using IaaS and VMs, you should consider the following:
- Test and development: quickly setup and tear down test & dev environments to push apps out faster. 
- Website hosting: using IaaS and VMs can make running websites less expensive than traditional hosting.
- High-performance computing (HPC): HPC can solve complex problems that involve millions of calucations or variables. VMs enable this on clusters, computer grids, or supercomputers, providing the ability to support various scenarios. 
- Storage, backup, and recovery: VMs avoid expenses associated with storage and storage management. IaaS provides a simplified approach to handling unpredictable demand, as well as backup and recovery systems.
- Extended datacenters: VMs in Azure can help add capacity to an organizations datacenter, without requiring addition cost for physical hardware and additional maintenance. 
- Big data analysis: data mining allows you to discover hidden patterns that require a large amount of processing power, provided by IaaS in a more economical approach.


### Planning VM Configuration

Following a checklist will help you plan to configure a VM:
- Network configuration: VNets are used to provide private connectivity between your VMs and other services in Azure.
	- Resources on the same VNet can access one another; by default, any resources outside the VNet aren't able to connect to those within the VNet.
   	- Additional configuration is required to the network before external services can be accessed, including any on-prem servers.
		- Note: If your organizations private network is going to be connected to the services in Azure, make sure to consider the topology before creating VMs. 

- Name for the VM: the name of the VM will be configured as part of the OS.
	- Windows VMs allow names up to 15 characters long
	- Linux VMs allow names up to 64 characters long
   		- Note: make sure to pick a naming convention that's meaningful and standardized.
       		- Ex: produsc-webvm01 would be used for the first production web server in the US South Central location.

- Location for the VM: the region in which you create your VM will be where the resources are allocated.
  	- Choosing a regional location allows your VM to be close to your users.
  		- Note: the location of the VM can improve performance and is an important decision to ensure you meet legal, tax, and/or compliance requirements.
  	 - Location can limit your options for hardware and configurations.
  	 - Location can also determine the pricing - some regions will be more expensive than others.

- Size of the VM: depending on the type of workload the VM will be running will determine the memory and storage sizes your machine will require.
  	- Azure allows you to resize VMs when the size no longer meets your needs if the hardware configuration is allowed in the new size.
  	- This provides an agile and elastic approach to VM management.
  	  	- Note: you can select any size available in your region when you stop & deallocate the VM. However, you should use caution resizing production machines as resizing might require a reboot or change the IP address, causing a temp outage.

- Review the pricing model to estimate costs: subscriptions are billed two charges for each VM; compute and storage. These costs being separate allow you to scale them and pay for only what you need.
	- Compute: paid on a per-hour basis and billed on a per-minute basis.
   		- Consumption-based means you pay for the compute capacity per second. This option allows you to increase or decrease the capcity on demand, allowing you to start or stop as needed.
   			- This option is best if your organization runs apps with unpredictable or short-term workloads that cannot be interrupted, such as quick tests or developing apps in VMs.
 		- Reserved VM Instances (RI) provides an option to purchase a VM for one or three years, in a specific region. While this option requires a commitment made up front, you save up to 72% compared to the pay-as-you-go pricing model.
     			- This option is best if the VM needs to run continuously OR if you need a predictable budget, if you can commit to using the VM for a minimum of one year.
     			- RIs can be exchanged or returned with an early term fee. 
   	- Storage: charged separately for the Azure Storage used by the VM.
   		- Status of the machine doesn't determine the charges incurred.

- Select an OS to use: pick between different versions of Windows or Linux.
  	- The cost of the OS license is included in the price.
  	- Use the Azure Marketplace to search for more than just base OS images. This allows you to install images that have the OS and additional software.
  	  	- Ex: A Linux server, Apache web server, MySQL database, and PHP are included in an image stack.
  	- You can also create your own disk image if you cannot find one that suits your needs.
  	  	- Note: Azure only supports 64-bit OS.

- Identify the Azure Storage to use: Azure Managed Disks handle the storage account creation & management for you.
  	- Disk size & performance (standard or premium) can be selected.
  	- Adding disks or scaling up/down is possible. 

- Determine VM storage: all Azure VMs have *at least* two disks: an OS and a temporary disk. However, they can have one or more data disks.
  	- All disks are stored as Virtual Hard Disks (VHDs), which are like physical disks in on-prem servers, just virtualized.
  		- OS disk: every VM will have one OS disk attached.
  	   		- These disks contain the pre-installed OS and are registered as a Serial Advanced Technology Attachedment (SATA) drive.
  	  		- OS disks will be labled as the C: drive by default.
  	   	- Temp disk: data on these disks could be lost during maintenance or upon deployment, however, it should persist upon a normal reboot of the VM.
  	   	  	- Windows: by default, this drive will be labeled the D: drive and is used to store the pagefil.sys file.
  	   	  	- Linux: this drive is usually /dev/sdb and is formatted & mounted to /mnt by the Azure Linux Agent.
				- Important: data on the temp drive should not be critical to the system as it could be lost upon moving to a new host.
  	   	- Data disks: these are managed disks and used to store app data, or any other data that's needed to be kept.
  	   	  	- Registered as SCSI drives and are able to be labeled a letter of your choice.
  	   	  	  	- Note: the size of the VM determines how many data disks can be attached and the kind of storage that can be used to host these disks.
  	   	  	 
### Storage considerations

- Azure Premium Storage: gain high-performance, low-latency disk support for VMs with input/output (I/O)-intensive workloads.
  	- Premium Storage stored data on SSDs.
  	- Existing VM disks can be migrated to Premium Storage.

- Multiple Storage disks: using multiple disks allows your apps up to 256 TB of storage space per VM.
  	- Premium Storage allows your apps to achieve 80,000 I/O operations per second (IOPS) per VM & a disk throughput up to 2,000 MB/s per VM.
  	- Read operations yield low latencies with Premium Storage.

- Managed disks: Azure Managed Disks are VHDs and are stored as page blobs which are a random IO storage object.
  	- These disks are considered *managed* because they are an abstraction over page blobs, blob containers, and Azure storage accounts.
  	- You provision these disks while Azure handles creating and managing them.
  	- These types of disks are available in Ultra SSD, Premium SSD, Standard SSD, and Standard HDD.
  	  	- Note: These disks are required for the single instance VM SLA.
  	 
- Migrating to Premium Storage: Microsoft recommends migrating VM disks that require high IOPS to Premium Storage for the best performance.
	- If the disk doesn't require high IOPS, reduce your cost by keeping it in standard storage.


### Creating VMs in Azure portal

The first thing to decide is which image to use while creating a VM in the Azure portal. The portal will guide you through the config process while creating the machine image.

- Basics tab: contains the admin account, project details, and inbound port rules.
- Disks tab: select the OS disk type & data disks.
- Networking tab: create VNets and load balancing.
- Management tab: enable auto-shutdown and configure backup details.
- Advanced tab: configure scripts, agents, or VM extensions.
- Monitoring & Tabs tabs: additional settings are available.

### Connecting to VMs

You can connect to your VMs in Azure in multiple ways:
- Azure Bastion
- SSH
- RDP
- Cloud Shell


### Windows-based VMs

Connecting to a Windows VM hosted in Azure will be done using the Remote Desktop app (uses RDP). 
- Any version of Windows that's supported will have a GUI session.
	- The VMs IP address and port number will be needed to connect with this method. Azure will then allow you to download a RDP file to use to connect.

### Linux-based VMs

Connecting to a Linux VM hosted in Azure can be done using an SSH client. 
- You can reuse a single public-private key pair to access VMs and services, depending on the org's security policies.
	- WSL, Terminal, or Shell can be used as SSH clients to connect.
   	- The path to your private key file will be required. This key remains on your system and needs to be protected. 
   	- The public key will be placed on the Linux VM, or another service using public-key cryptography.

### Azure Bastion

Note: this is a platform managed PaaS service.

Bastion provides secure, seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to all VMs in the VNet, directly over SSL. 
- No IP address is required when connecting using the service.
- Azure Bastion protects VMs from exposing RDP/SSH ports externally.
	- Note: this service allows you to connect directly from Azure portal; no additional software is required.

### Planning for Maintenance

Availability plans for VMs need to include methods for unplanned and unexpected situations, and planned situations.

Unplanned hardware maintenance: these events happen when Azure predicts the a component associated to the physical machine is going to fail. When the platform predicts a failure, an unplanned hardware maintenance event will be issued.
	- Note: Azure uses Live Migration technology to migrate VMs from failing hardware to a fully functioning machine.
   	- Live Migration will only pause the VM for a short period of time and performance *might* be impacted before or after.

Unexpected downtime: these events happen when the infrastructure or hardware for your VM fails. This could include:
- Local network failures
- Rack level failures
- Local disk failures
	- Note: Azure will automatically migrate the VM to a healthy physical machine within the same datacenter when this occurs.

Regularly scheduled maintenance: these events are regular updates Microsoft makes to the Azure platform to help improve reliability, security, and performance of the infrastructure VMs run on.
- It's important to remember that *most* of these will not impact any VM or service running in Azure.
  	- Note: Microsoft does not automatically update VM OS or other software. You are fully responsible for these updates. Only the underlying software is updated periodically, as well as the hardware.

### Availability sets

There are several things to remember about availability sets, including but not limited to:
- A VM and an availability set can be created at the same time
  	- Note: VMs can only be added to an availability set when the VM is created. Changing the availability set requires deleting the VM and then recreating it.
- Availability sets can be built using the following options:
  	- Azure portal
  	- ARM templates
  	- Scripting
  	- API tools
- All VMs within an availability set should perform the same set of functions
- All VMs within an availability set should have the same software installed
- VMs in an availability set will run across multiple servers, racks, storage units, and switches.
  	- Note: if hardware or Azure software fails, only a subset of the VMs in the set are impacted and the app will continue to be available.
- SLAs are provided by Microsoft for VMs and availability sets.

*Important: Availability sets won't protect the apps from OS of app failures.*

When using availability sets, consider the following:
- Redundancy
- Load balancing: for high availability & network performance
- Separation of application tiers: to help mitigate single points of failure
- Managed disks: for block-level storage

An availability set is a logical grouping of virtual machines hosting your application. These consist of update domains (UDs) and fault domains (FDs). Each VM you create will have a UD and FD that's associated with it. 
- Note: you can have up to 3 FDs and 20 UDs.
  - The default number of UDs is 5. If you create more than 5 VMs, the 6th VM will be placed on the 1st UD, the 7th on the 2nd UD, and so on.

Deploying multiple instances of your app will help you achieve High Availability (HA), which removes the risk of a single point of failure. 

FDs represent a set of VMs that have the same network switch, A/C, and power.
- Note: you can only configure up to 3 FDs, which is the default value when setting up availability sets.

UDs represent a group of VMs and the host, which can be updated & rebooted at the same time. 
- Note: only one UD will be rebooted at a time during scheduled maintenance, such as patching, firmware updates, etc.
  - While one is being rebooted, 30mins is required before the next scheduled task will begin on another domain. 

Creating availability sets can be done using:
- Azure portal
- Azure PowerShell
- Azure CLI

Information required to create availability sets:
- Subscription
- Resource group
- Name
- Region
- Number of FDs
- Number of UDs
- Disk alignment (use of managed disks)

### Fault domains and Update domains

VM Availability sets implement two node concepts to achieve high availability and fault tolerance:

Update domains: these are a group of nodes that get upgraded together during service upgrades and allow Azure to incrementally upgrade across a deployment. 
- Can be updated and rebooted at the same time
- Only one update domain is rebooted at a time during planned maintenance
- There are 5 UDs by default
- Up to 20 UDs can be configured

Fault domains: these are a group of nodes representing physical units of failure. 
- Two FDs work together to prevent hardware failure, network outages, power interruptions, and/or software updates.
- FDs are a group of VMs sharing the same hardware, or network switch, and sharing the same single point of failure.

### Availability zones

Each Azure region has unique physical locations. These locations are called zones and make up one or more datacenters that has its own power, networking, and cooling. Deploying apps to multiple zones can provide protection from datacenter failure as we can create instances in different zones within a region. 
- If a zone suffers an outage, instances will be deployed in different zones to maintain availability.

When creating a VM, you can select which zone to deploy to. 

*Note: Availability zones can help improve SLAs of your applications.*

- Availability zones are unique, *physical* locations within a region in Azure.
- Physical separation within regions protects against datacenter failures.
- Each zone has one, or more, datacenters equipped with power, cooling, and networking independently.
- Zone-redundant services will replicate apps and data across the availability zones, protecting against single points of failure.
- A minimum of 3 separate zones exist within enabled regions.

There are two categories of services that support availability zones:
Zonal services: these pin each resource to a zone
- Azure VMs
- Managed disks
- Standard IP addresses
 
Zone-redundant services: these replicate automatically across *all* zones
- Azure SQL DB
- Zone-redundant Azure Storage

*Important: Availability zones help businesses achieve business continuity while using Azure services. However, you should build the architecture of your apps using a combo of availability zones and region pairs.*
