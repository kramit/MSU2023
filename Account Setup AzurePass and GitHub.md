# How to use the Azure Pass

Note: Microsoft Accounts (hotmail.com / outlook.com) can only have 1 Azure Pass assigned to them every 12 months. Do not use your existing outlook/live account if you have one. Make a new one that is only for use with this Azure Pass. I don't care that you already have an Azure test environment, I don't care that you already made a trial account, I don't care that you have already done a Microsoft course and want to use that same account again. REGISTER A NEW OUTLOOK ACCOUNT FOR YOUR AZURE PASS. 

The reasoning behind that is you are going to be building and tearing down and re-building and changing authorisations and changing settings and all the other things we do in an Azure course that you don't want anywhere near your existing work. Keep test land and live land separate.

Students must follow these instructions carefully as replacement Azure Pass codes cannot be issued.
