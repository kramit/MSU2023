## Zendesk API

This takes your zendesk API access so you can talk to zendesk over powershell. This was investigated becuase Zendesk only allow the exporting of customer emails if you have a high tier of payment/subscription. Yet all tiers have access to the API which responds in JSON with all the emails if you target the right bit..... so send that to a CSV and you have your list of client emails to do what you want with.
