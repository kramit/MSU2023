**Course Explanation**

AZ-900
AZ-104 + Exam
AZ-305 + Exam

Between these courses there is ALOT of crossover of material. We will be using the Microsoft slide decks and labs for these courses in addition to more material. I promise to try my best not to kill you will slides, I will make the slides available to you via this Github repo if you really want to read all the points in the sides. 

Each of these courses are taught normally over 4 days each, we have much more time than this. A good portion of the time in this course will need to be self study upon behalf of the student.

These exams are not easy, and at the end of a course under normal public course conditions the recommendation is to study for a couple of weeks after the course to prep for the exam. We do not have that luxury. 

If you work hard for the next few weeks, study and read all the material set out for you, then you will have the knowledge to be able to take and pass the exams without any problems.

The case studies will also be provided for you to work upon and complete during the course, they will include some scenarios for you to build and test for you to  work upon the Azure platform.

**Labs**

We will have some online labs, actually, there will be a lot of online labs. They are provided by godeploy.it and the custom page for glasspaper is https://gp.labsonline.it/

Please register a new account on https://gp.labsonline.it/ I as the instructor will issue out lab codes for you to redeem as we get to the relevant parts of the course.

Go on, go register, do it now. then come back here. I'll wait.

**Read the following and use this as an index**

Account Setup AzurePass and GitHub.md - This will show you how to get your azure accounts set up, have a look, I have the azure pass keys to give you free credit. I will give them out when the time comes

allexamlinks.md - this is all the Microsoft docs pages that the exams could reference (Don't Panic its just to give you an idea)

Timeline.md - This is what we are going to be doing for the next 7 weeks, you can come back to this to see what is on the agenda

Case Studies/CaseStudyReadme.md - info for the Case Studies you will be creating and presenting at the end of the course.

Each of these course folders will have the slides for the courses and the instructor manual. These slides are provided as they come from Microsoft. The instructor manual is a PDF version of the ebooks you have been provided on skillpipe.com, Microsoft don't like students using the PDf's but I find it makes things so much easier for you than using a DRM eBook.

 I personally hate slides and will try my best to avoid them and do as many demos as I can, they do help me in remembering what I have to talk about though. So expect me as an instructor to skim past and delete a lot of slides, simply so you don't have an instructor reading bullet points out on a slide deck for 7 weeks. As this would then mean you would probably want to throw yourself out of the window after a couple of days and I would have a lot of paperwork to fill out. 

AZ-040 - Powershell course

AZ-104 - First real azure course

AZ-303 - Old advanced azure course (only for reference)

AZ-304 - Old Architecture Course (only for reference)

AZ-305 - The advanced course we will be doing (combination of 303+304)

AZ-900 - 1 Day intro into Azure/cloud course, this is really for sales people to be able to think they know what they are talking about and to use the right buzzwords at the right time.

WS-011 - A windows server course based around server 2019 (we don't have this on the agenda but I find it useful to include)
