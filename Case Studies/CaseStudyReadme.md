# Case Study Readme

There are 3 case studies here, you only have choose 2 out of the 3 to do. It does not matter which 2.

The point of the case studies is to show that you can take a clients needs and design and azure solution that would meet the needs of the client, you will then need to present this solution to some members of Microsoft and the rest of the MSU group. 

It will not be too stressful and I have attempted to keep the case studies to solution that we will cover in class.   

I really advise that you have Github repos created for your projects, this will make things much simpler when showing them off. 

Take a look at an example from the MSU2021 completed by a student on that course that uses all the azure icon sets and a well formatted Github repo for his project https://github.com/kramit/contosocoffee

You can start working on these Case Studies whenever you feel like it, there are dedicated days to work on them too so we will have plenty of time, but you really do need to have them completed and squared away by the end of the course. When giving the presentations, the Microsoft guys love it when you use the azure icon sets in your powerpoint presentations https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/icons/ they love a good Viso type diagram, try using something like this tool https://online.visual-paradigm.com/diagrams/features/azure-architecture-diagram-tool/
